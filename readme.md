</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>GUI won't load on Linux (XOrg/X11)</strong></summary>

If the GUI works on Wayland but not on XOrg/X11 (common on Linux Mint and VMware), you're missing Qt platform plugins. See the [Linux GUI Troubleshooting Guide](docs/LINUX_GUI_TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for the solution.

**Quick fix for Ubuntu/Debian/Mint:**

```bash
sudo apt-get install libxcb-xinerama0 libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-image0 libxcb-keysyms1 libxcb-randr0 libxcb-render-util0 libxcb-shape0 libxkbcommon-x11-0 libxcb-cursor0
