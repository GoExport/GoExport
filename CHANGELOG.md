## [0.16.0] - 2025-10-09

This is a large update for both GUI and CLI versions, as well as GoExport for Linux. It fixes various bugs and improves compatibility.

Huge thanks to the following who helped debug, test, and provide feedback for this update:

## Important Announcement

With the release of GoExport 0.16.0, we've drastically improved third party integration, which also includes first party addons and tools from us.

We're excited to announce that with the release of GoExport v0.16.0, we've introduced a new Wrapper: Offline modification; called "GoExport Mod." You can find it [here](https://github.com/GoExport/GoExport-Mod)

In the future, we also plan to release a chrome extension, which will also integrate with GoExport seamlessly.

### Added

- Added a GUI for Windows and Linux.
- Separated GUI and interactive terminal modes to separate executables for better user experience. `GoExport_CLI.exe` is the command line version, while `GoExport.exe` is the GUI version.
- Added 2K - 8K 16:9 resolutions (2560x1440, 3840x2160, 5120x2880, 7680x4320).
- Added auto update detection and notification for both GUI and CLI versions.
- Added Native Capture for Linux using `ffmpeg` (which is already included) as an alternative to using OBS for screen capturing.
- Added a protocol in the Windows installer to allow opening and executing GoExport from a web browser (for example, type `goexport://?...` in the address bar of your browser to open GoExport with specific parameters) and it'll automatically launch GoExport CLI. This allows for easier integration with third-party tools and websites. **Note: Ensure you have GoExport installed for this to work. If using Linux, you'll have to manually define the protocol handler.**
- Added a variety of documentation files in the repository /docs folder.
- Added a checkbox in the GUI to allow users to choose whether to install documentation files during installation.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where GoExport would downscale your video to 720p even if you selected a higher resolution. Credits: [@QuaixiAnimations](https://www.youtube.com/@QuaixiAnimations) and [@GoSkit2](https://www.youtube.com/@GoSkit2)
- Fixed an issue where GoExport would require `Glibc 2.38` on Linux, now requires `Glibc 2.35` instead for improved compatibility. Credits: [@Go!Makers](https://www.youtube.com/@goskit2)
- Added support for more file managers on Linux including Dolphin, Nautilus, Thunar, and PCManFM. Credits: [@Go!Makers](https://www.youtube.com/@goskit2)
- Fixed an issue where GoExport on Linux would not open the browser in Kiosk mode. (Fullscreen)

## [0.15.4] - 2025-09-28

### Added

- Added GoExport to path on Windows during installation, allowing you to run GoExport from any command prompt or terminal without needing to navigate to its installation directory.

### Changed

- GoExport no longer packages the dependencies within the executable. This is to reduce the size of the executable and to minimize load time. The dependencies will remain in the `dependencies` folder in the GoExport installation directory.

## [0.15.3] - 2025-09-06

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where FlashThemes would respond with a 403 error when trying to check if the website is online.

## [0.15.2] - 2025-09-05

### Fixed

- Added delay to OBS setup to ensure it doesn't crash OBS on slower computers.
- Fixed an issue where default inputs didn't auto populate when no data was in the data.json file.
- Renamed "Local" service to "Wrapper Offline" - You still type "Local" when accessing Wrapper Offline.
- Added a check to ensure the selected service is online, this will hopefully prevent issues where the user selects a service that is offline (for example, Wrapper Offline is not opened).
- Fixed an issue where GoExport didn't report that the selected resolution was too high for the monitor resolution properly.

## [0.15.1] - 2025-09-01

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where if OBS wasn't installed, GoExport would cease to function.

## [0.15.0] - 2025-09-01

### Added

- Added support for FlashThemes

## [0.14.4] - 2025-08-31

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where GoExport couldn't automatically detect the correct browser on Linux when capturing with OBS.

### Added

- Added "Local (beta)" service which is a beta version of Local which experiments using Wrapper Offline's own video player, which resolves the watermark issue, but the caveat is that Wrapper Offline requires modification.

## [0.14.3] - 2025-08-31

GoExport's companion app, GoExport Outro Maker, has received an update as well, which is used in conjunction with this update. If you use GOM (GoExport Outro Maker), make sure to update it to the latest version to ensure compatibility.

### Fixed

## [0.12.3] - 2025-08-25

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where OBS resolution wouldn't change
- Mouse is no longer repositioned off screen regardless of recording method (Because both methods don't capture the mouse)

## [0.12.2] - 2025-08-25

### Fixed

- Fixed OBS.md to contain correct flags

### Added

- Added memory (When you run GoExport, it will remember what you picked so that it can be quickly replicated.)
- Your OBS settings will also be saved to disk when you use an OBS related command line flag.
- Redid the splash screen to appear more modern and fancy.
- Added OBS flag that will prevent OBS from making changes to your settings (This does not mean it won't create a profile and switch to it, this is also an advance feature, and should only be used if you know what you're doing. You'd want to use it if you want to customize GoExport in OBS, but this is not recommended.)

### Changed

- Changed the way command line arguments are parsed to improve efficiency.
- Splash screen now tells you if GoExport is using OBS or not.
